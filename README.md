## This project was developed  for submitting the required proof of concept for A Research Proposal Idea to ISRO.

This project can be subdivided into these main elements-  
1) Get data from the ISRO's Chandrayan SAR payload along with the tiff image of that respective zone from various payloads of the chinese and european satellites.  
2) Extract required information from these Datasets and construct a database of the crater.
3)Use this dataset cosnsisting of features such as the era that the crater belonged to such as nectarian,pre-nectarian etc which would be our target column and this was dependent on many features such as the diameter of the crater,the elevation,nearby area maria
4) Do Feature selection ,Data cleaning and that apply SVM model
5) Recieved accuracy was -85 %
6) Another feature was to count the number of craters in a region and estimate the crater density of that area.  
7) Th last feature was to find a perfect landing site for possible space mission based on data such as latitude,longitude,elevation,size of boulders in the region etc.

The Link for the Machine Learning Model and the dataset is as follows-
